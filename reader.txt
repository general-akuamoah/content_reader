You have a MySQL database that represents objects and triangles, where each object contains several triangles. There is a table for the objects, and a table for all the triangles contained in each object. The [objects] table has the columns [id] and [name]. The [id] column is an auto incremented primary key. The [triangles] table has the columns [objectID], [side1] and [side2]. [objectID] has a parent-child relationship to the [id] column in the objects table and defines which triangles are contained in each object. [side1] and [side2] in the [triangles] table are the length of the sides of a right-angled triangle adjacent to the hypotenuse in meters. Write a SQL query using [group by] that calculates the sum of all of the hypotenuses of triangles belonging to an object
